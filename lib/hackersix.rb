Get the number of test cases.
Do a loop / iterator through the word (each_char)
Modulus, check if modulus equals to zero, if it is, it will be even.
Add these characters into even_word
Add these characters into odd_word
String interpolation
Loop through an array containing all the words.

# input = "Hacker"
# split the string into array => [“H”, “a”,..., “r”]
# loop based on the size of the array
# each loop:
# check each letters’ index inside array is even or odd
	# create 2 new array => even_arr, odd_arr
  # check each letters index inside array is even or odd
	# if index is even => push to even_arr
	# else push to odd_arr
# end of the loop
# join each array => even_str, odd_str
# concat them

# alternative
# accessing the index of string, w/o making an array
